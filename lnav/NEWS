lnav v0.8.0:
     Features:
     * Integration with "papertrailapp.com" for querying and tailing
       server log and syslog messages.  See the Papertrail section in
       the online help for more details.
     * Remote files can be opened when lnav is built with libcurl v7.23.0+
     * SQL queries can now be done on lines that match a regular expression
       using the "log_search" table or by creating custom tables with the
       ":create-search-table" command.
     * Log formats that are "containers" for other log formats, like
       syslog, are now supported.  See the online help for more
       information.
     * Formats can be installed from git repositories using the '-i' option.
       A standard set of extra formats can be installed by doing
       'lnav -i extra'. (You must have git installed for this to work.)
     * Added support for 'VMware vSphere Auto Deploy' log format.
     * Added a 'sudo' log format.
     * Added hotkeys to move left/right by a smaller increment (H/L or
       Shift+Left/Shift+Right).
     * A color-coded bar has been added to the left side to show where
       messages from one file stop and messages from another file start.
     * The '-C' option will now try to check any specified log files to
       make sure the format(s) match all of the lines.
     * Added an "all_logs" SQLite table that contains the message format
       extracted from each log line.  Also added a ';.msgformat' SQL command
       that executes a query that returns the counts for each format and the
       first line where the format was seen.
     * Added an "lnav_views" SQLite table that can be used to query and
       change the lnav view state.
     * When typing in a command, the status bar will display a short
       summary of the currently entered command.
     * Added a "delete-filter" command.
     * Added a "log_msg_instance" column to the logline and log_search
       tables to make it easier to join tables that are matching log
       messages that are ordered.
     * Added a "timeslice()" function to SQLite so that it is easier to
       group log messages by time buckets.
     * The 'goto' command now supports relative time values like
       'a minute ago', 'an hour later', and many more.

     Interface Changes:
     * The 'r/R' hotkeys have been reassigned to navigate through the log
       messages by the relative time value that was last used with the
       'goto' command.

     Fixes:
     * The pretty-print view should now work for text files.
     * Nested fields in JSON logs are now supported for levels, bodies, etc...
     * Tab-completion should work for quoted SQL identifiers.
     * 'lo-fi' mode key shortcut changed to CTRL+L.
     * 'redraw' shortcut removed. Relegated to just a command.
     * Fixed lnav hang in pretty-print mode while doing a dns lookup.
     * The generic log message parser used to extract data has been
       optimized and should be a bit faster.

lnav v0.7.3:
     Features:
     * Add 'pipe-to' and 'pipe-line-to' commands that pipe the currently
       marked lines or the current log message to a shell command,
       respectively.
     * Added a "pretty-print" view (P hotkey) that tries to reformat log
       messages so that they are easier to read.
     * Added a 'redraw' command (CTRL+L hotkey) to redraw the window in
       case it has been corrupted.
     * Added a 'relative-goto' command to move the current view relative
       to its current position.
     * Experimental support for linking with jemalloc.
     * The plain text view now supports filtering.
     * Added 'next-mark' and 'prev-mark' commands to jump to the next or
       previous bookmarked line (e.g. error, warning, ...)
     * Added a 'zoom-to' command to change the zoom level of the histogram
       view.
     * Log formats can now define their own timestamp formats with the
       'timestamp-format' field.

     Fixes:
     * Autotools scripts overhaul.
     * Added a configure option to disable linking with libtinfo. The newer
       versions of ncurses don't require it, however the build silently pulls
       it in as a dependency, if it is available on the system. This can be
       explicitly disabled using the '--disable-tinfo' option during configure.
     * Fixed the configure script behavior to ignore the values specified using
       the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment variables while searching for sqlite3
       when '--with-sqlite3' switch was specified without the prefix.
     * The configure script now recognizes libeditline symlink'ed to masquerade
       as libreadline. This previously used to cause problems at compile time,
       specially on OS X. If you come across this error, use the
       '--with-readline=prefix' switch to specify the path to the correct
       location of libreadline.
     * The order that log formats are tried against a log file is now
       automatically determined so that more specific formats are tested
       before more general ones.  The order is determined on startup based on
       how each format matches each other formats sample lines.
     * Command files (i.e. those executed via the '-f' flag) now support
       commands/queries that span more than one line.
     * Added more log levels: stats, debug2 - debug5.

lnav v0.7.2:
     * Added log formats for vdsm, openstack, and the vmkernel.
     * Added a "lo-fi" mode (L hotkey) that dumps the displayed log lines
       to the terminal without any decorations.  The write-to, write-json-to,
       and write-csv-to commands will also write their output to the terminal
       when passed '-' as the file name.  This mode can be useful for copying
       plain text lines to the clipboard.
     * (OS X) Text search strings are copied to the system's "find" clipboard.
       Also, when starting a new search, the current value in the "find"
       clipboard can be tab-completed.

lnav v0.7.1:
     Features:
     * Added an 'environ' SQL table that reflects lnav's environment
       variables.  The table can be read and written to using SQL
       SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.  Setting variables
       can be a way to use SQL query results in lnav commands.
     * Added a 'jget' SQLite function that can extract fields from a JSON-
       encoded value.
     * Added log formats for the OpenAM identity provider.
     * Added a 'clear-highlight' command to clear previous calls to the
       'highlight' command.
     * Fixed some performance bugs in indexing JSON log formats.  Loading
       times should be at least five times faster.
     * Filtering performance should be improved so that enabling/disabling
       filters should be almost instantaneous.
     * The filter-in, filter-out, and highlight commands now support
       tab-completion of text in the current view.
     * Add a '-i' flag that installs format files in: ~/.lnav/formats/installed

lnav v0.7.0:
     Features:
     * Add the '.schema' SQL command to open a view that displays the schema
       for the internal tables and any attached databases.  If lnav was only
       executed with a SQLite database and no text files, this view will open
       by default.
     * The scroll bar now indicates the location of errors/warnings, search
       hits, and bookmarks.
     * The xterm title is update to reflect the file name for the top line
       in the view.
     * Added a "headless" mode so that you can execute commands and run SQL
       queries from the command-line without having to do it from the curses
       UI.
     * When doing a search or SQL query, any text that is currently being
       displayed can be tab-completed.
     * The '-H' option was added so you can view the internal help text.
     * Added the 'g/G' hotkeys to move to the top/bottom of the file.
     * Added a 'log_mark' column to the log tables that indicates whether or
       not a log message is bookmarked.  The field is writable, so you can
       bookmark lines using an SQL UPDATE query.
     * Added syntax-highlighting when editing SQL queries or search regexes.
     * Added a "write-json-to" command that writes the result of a SQL query
       to a JSON-formatted file.
     * The "elapsed time" column now uses red/green coloring to indicate
       sharp changes in the message rate.
     * Added a "set-min-log-level" command to filter out log messages that
       are below a given level.

     Fixes:
     * Performance improvements.
     * Multi-line filtering has been fixed.
     * A collator has been added to the log_level column in the log tables
       so that you can write expressions like "log_level > 'warning'".
     * The log_time datetime format now matches what is returned by
       "datetime('now')" so that collating works correctly.
     * If a search string is not valid PCRE syntax, a search is done for
       the exact string instead of just returning an error.
     * Static-linking has been cleaned up.
     * OpenSSL is no longer a requirement.
     * Alpha support for Windows/cygwin.
     * Environment variables can now be accessed in SQL queries using
       the syntax: $VAR_NAME
     * An internal log is kept and written out on a crash.
     * Partition bookmarks are now tracked separately from regular user
       bookmarks.  You can start a partition with the 'partition-name'
       command and remove it with the 'clear-partition' command.
     * Improved display of possible matches during tab-completion in the
       command-prompt.  The matches are now shown in a separate view and
       pressing tab repeatedly will scroll through the view.
     * The "open" command now does shell word expansion for file names.
     * More config directory paths have been added: /etc/lnav,
       $prefix/etc/lnav, and directories passed on the command-line with -I.

lnav v0.6.2:
     Features:
     * Word-wrap support.

     Fixes:
     * Fix some OS X Mavericks build/runtime issues.

lnav v0.6.1:
     Features:
     * Support for JSON-encoded log files.

     Fixes:
     * Some minor fixes and performance improvements.

lnav v0.6.0:
     Features:
     * Custom log formats and more builtin formats
     * Automatic extraction of data from logs
     * UI improvements, support for 256 color terminals

lnav v0.5.1:
     Features:
     * Added the '-t' and '-w' options which can be used to prepend a
       timestamp to any data piped in on stdin and to specify a file to
       write the contents of stdin to.

     Fixes:
     * Cleanup for packaging.

lnav v0.5.0:
     Features:
     * Files can be specified on the command-line using wildcards so that
       new files are automatically loaded.  Directories can also be passed
       as command-line arguments to read all of the files in the directory.
     * Builds on cygwin again.
     * Added the 'C' hotkey to clear any existing user bookmarks.
     * Added experimental support for accepting input from mice.

     Fixes:
     * Internal cleanup.
     * Copying to the clipboard on OS X is now supported.
     * Many bug fixes.

lnav v0.4.0:
     Features:
     * Files that are not recognized as containing log messages have been
       broken out to a separate text files view.  You can flip between the
       log view and the text file view with the 't' hotkey.  When viewing
       text files, the 'f' hotkey will switch between files.
     * Files compressed with bzip2 are recognized and decompressed on the
       fly.
     * Added a "session" file and command for storing commands that should
       be executed on startup.  For example, if you always want some
       highlighting to be done, you can add that command to the session
       file.

     Fixes:
     * Add some more log file formats for generic log files.
     * Performance improvements for compressed files.
     * Works on OS X now.

lnav v0.3.0:
     Changes:
     * The hotkey for the SQL view was changed to 'v' and 'V' from '.'.

     Features:
     * You can now switch between the SQL result view and the log view while
       keeping the top of the views in sync with the "line_number" column.

     Fixes:
     * The "line_number" column is no longer included in the SQL result view's
       stacked bar graph.
     * Added a "warnings" count to the histogram view.
